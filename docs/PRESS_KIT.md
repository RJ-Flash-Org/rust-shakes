## Pitches

- One-liner: Batteries-included Rust stack for numerics, data, and ML.
- Three-liner: Python-class ergonomics with Rust-grade performance and safety. HyperC fast builds, Arrow interop, and a cookbook-driven onboarding. Built for researchers and engineers who want speed without losing DX.
- One paragraph: Rust-Shakes aims to make Rust the most productive place to build scientific and ML software—without giving up safety or speed. We combine world-class ergonomics with Rust fundamentals: memory safety, performance, and deployability. Early milestones focus on HyperC (10× rebuilds), a shared numerics core, and Arrow-native DataFrames, with predictable governance and a contributor-first experience.
