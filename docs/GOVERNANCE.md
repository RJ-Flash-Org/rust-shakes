# Governance

- **Steering Council**: sets roadmap, accepts RFCs, appoints release leads.
- **Code Owners**: per-repo ownership with documented escalation paths.
- **RFC Process**: all non-trivial changes start as an RFC issue using the template.
- **Decision Making**: lazy consensus â†’ vote by Council if contention persists.
- **Releases**: release leads rotate; changelogs required; perf gates enforced.
