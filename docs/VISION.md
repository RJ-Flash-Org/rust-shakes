# Vision

Rust-Shakes is a **Rust-first scientific and ML ecosystem** that pairs *Python-level ergonomics* with *Rust-grade performance, safety, and deployability*. We remove the last excuses for not choosing Rust in data work: slow iteration, weak interop, and fragmented APIs.

## Design Tenets
1) **Ergonomics win adoptions** – APIs should feel obvious, errors should teach.  
2) **One numeric core** – shared dtypes/traits/errors across libraries.  
3) **Interop is a feature** – Arrow everywhere, PyPI wheels for frictionless trials.  
4) **Reproducible performance** – benchmarks in CI; perf regressions block releases.  
5) **Governance & docs** – sustainable community over heroics.
