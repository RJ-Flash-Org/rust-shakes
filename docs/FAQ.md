# FAQ

**Why Rust over Python for data/ML?**  
Performance, safety, deployability. Rust-Shakes adds ergonomics and interop to close the gap.

**Do I need to abandon Python?**  
No. Arrow + wheels let you migrate incrementally.

**When can I try something real?**  
M1 (HyperC preview) and M2 (foundry+rax alpha) targeted first; see ROADMAP.
