- Public disclosure only after a fix is available or within 90 days, whichever comes first
- Coordinated disclosure through GitHub Security Advisories is preferred

## Supported Versions

## Embargo & Disclosure

- Default embargo: **up to 90 days** or until a fix is released (whichever comes first).
- We assign preliminary severity using **CVSS 3.1**; critical issues may trigger out-of-band releases.
